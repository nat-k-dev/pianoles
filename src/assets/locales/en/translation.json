  "history_text_1": "Hello. My name is Emily. Playing piano is my passion and I am happy to teach people to play piano. I studied music in a music school and then in a conservatorium. After graduation I worked at school as a music teacher. My pupils learned how to play their favorite songs on piano. Five years ago I started to teach adults to play piano. I opened a music studio in a city center to make my lessons easily avaiable for people from different corners of our town.",
